## shrtcts YAML format

**shrtcts** initially provided a way to specify the shortcuts in a YAML file.
This made sense because everything is YAML these days,
so why not add yet another YAML config file to the mix?
But writing R code inside YAML is, um, less than ideal.
So it's no longer recommended, but it is still supported (for now).
To convert existing shortcuts from YAML to the roxygen2 format,
use the internal `shrtcts:::migrate_yaml2r()` function.

Use the following template to organize your `.shrtcts.yaml`. 
Each shortcut is a YAML list item with the following structure:

```yaml
- Name: Make A Noise
  Description: Play a short sound
  Binding: beepr::beep
  Interactive: true
  id: 42
  shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+B
```
